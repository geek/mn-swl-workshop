## Challenge 9

![image](../images/challenge9.png)

ContainerPilot supports reporting on telemetry data to Prometheus. The _docker-compose.yml_ file has been updated with a Prometheus service that is discoverable from consul. Your challenge is to update the new telemetry entry in the frontend _containerpilot.json_ configuration with a sensor for the _memory.sh_ script to send free memory data to Prometheus.

__hint__ refer to the ContainerPilot [configuration telemetry documentation](https://www.joyent.com/containerpilot/docs/telemetry).
